# Week 1 Homework

A simple responsive website showing some of my favorite places in New York, using
[Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [One Page Wonder](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/one-page-wonder/)
and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)

## Bugs and Issues

Maps can be shown properly in Atom's auto html preview, but cannot be shown when opening in browser.
